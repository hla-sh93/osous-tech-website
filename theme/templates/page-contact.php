 * Contact form.
 *
 * The sections are the page's own blocks, in the order the editor holds them: this file is
 * the kind's frame -- the header, the page's blocks, the footer -- and the place for
 * anything every page of this kind must carry. A new page of this kind starts from
 * patterns/starters/contact.php. A page keeps this template whatever its slug becomes;
 * WordPress stores the choice on the page itself.
